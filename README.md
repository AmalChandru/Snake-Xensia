Every 90's kids misses the good old days of Nokia's Snake xensia. As a part of Tinkerhub hirehack, i am implementing a simple, realtime multiplayer snake game built upon `Javascript` and `Socket.IO.` I tried my most to keep the UI as simple as possible.

## Features

- Simple UI
- Written with uncomplicated JS (JavaScript)
- Realtime event handling by the aid of socket.io
- Supports on multiple browsers
- uses Netlify & Heroku for Deployment.

## Local Installation

- Clone down the repo and up `xensia.html` on any browser
- `cd`into server and run `npx nodemon server.js`

## How to play..?

Yes, you guessed it üòé. Use up,down,left,right arrows for controlling your snake

## This works because of ...

- The learnings from [MDN Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), [Snake Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TcU2C1AACw), [Socket Documentation](https://socket.io/get-started/chat)
- npm, yarn, vscode, liveserver, linux


## Note
Why not use React for this project?
Simple. I had to keep this simple ‚ù§Ô∏è
